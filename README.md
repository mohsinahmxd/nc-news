# Northcoders News Front-End

Link to live version: https://mohsins-news-site.netlify.app/

In this project, I have built a front-end for a back-end API that I developed a couple of weeks prior. The back-end API serves as the data source for this front-end application, providing endpoints for retrieving articles, comments, user information, and more. By building this front-end, users can interact with the data served by the API in a user-friendly and intuitive manner.
